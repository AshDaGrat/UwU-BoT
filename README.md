# UwU-Bot
# DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE, NEEDS UPDATING

A discord bot that corrects you whenever you say something un-uwu

If your message contains the letter r or the letter l, you best believe it will correct your bad un-uwu language

Made using discord.js 12.5.4 since I had some errors with discord.js v13

Add your discord bot token to where it says "TOKEN"

The permissions required are reading and sending messages and manage webhooks
